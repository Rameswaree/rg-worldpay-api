A REST API Payment using Java and Spring Boot

Note: This application will fetch all the records present in the table. It also has the provision to add new records. Although it does not show any error message while trying to add a duplicate offer into the table, it does not allow duplicate records to be added. Similarly, if a record is not in EXPIRED status, the order gets cancelled successfully. If the order is already expired, then it does not update anything on that record.

Steps to run the application:

1. Clone the git repository or download the extract zip file.
2. Open the project using IntelliJ Idea or any other IDE that you use.
